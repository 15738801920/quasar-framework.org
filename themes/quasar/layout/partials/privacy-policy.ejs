      It is not required to grant the app any device permissions in order to use Quasar Play,
      however use of the QR code-scanning option requires allowing the app access your device's
      camera. This is the only device permission the app will ever request, and it is the only
      purpose for which the device's camera will ever be used by Quasar Play.
